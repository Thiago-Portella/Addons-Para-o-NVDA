<h3>CloudVision</h3>
<p>The add-on provides a description of photos, for example, a 23-year-old girl with blonde hair smiling,
text recognition,
text translation into another language
and reading QR codes.</p>
<h3>Add-on settings.</h3>
<p>Open NVDA menu, Preferences, CloudVision Settings.</p>
<h3>Keyboard shortcuts</h3>
<ul>
<li>NVDA + CTRL + I - recognize the navigator object or the selected file in Explorer. If you press twice quickly, the result will appear in the virtual viewing window.</li>
<li>the gesture is not assigned - copy the last result to the clipboard. To assign, see NVDA menu, Preferences, input gestures, CloudVision category.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the navigator, just set it to the desired element, press the combination and the add-on will recognize it.
For a file, select it in Windows Explorer without opening it, immediately, without opening the file, press the combination.
Only JPG, PNG, GIF are supported.
I did not add a PDF, since recognition can last 40 minutes or longer.</p>
<p>The idea and code for the selected files is taken from the "Nao (NVDA Advanced OCR)" add-on.</p>
